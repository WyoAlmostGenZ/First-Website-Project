    <h3 class="cheesecakes"> More about me ...</h3>
      <img class="information" src="information.png" alt="info.png">
  <p class="artykul">27 year old Polish dude living in Italy for the past 13
      years i quit school after art highschool
  to persue what was at that time my dream career ProGaming in a game called
      Dota 2 i reached a semi high rank
  (top 300 eu ) but that wasnt very high compared to the best players and i
      simply wasn't good enought at that
  time i was also very stupid and had no idea on how to approach this as a career so i
      just played Matchmaking games
  did no socializing and was basicly without friends and nobody knew about me , if i could go back
      to the rank i was before and to the skill
      i had before i
     would maybe try once more but after almost 4 years of not playing
      im literal newbie . Now i'm learning programming and web developement and i like it a lot ^_^
